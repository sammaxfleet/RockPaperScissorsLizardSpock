Responsive Image



# Purpose Of the Game
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a brain game.
The game presents to you four different outcomes with each choice. 
2 win and 2 lose. 

I've set up the game so it's the User vs the A.I competing against each other go for go. 
The aim of the game is to get the User's thinking patterns going and competitive nature to beat the computer.
The game is good for all ages, so the specific target audience in particular can be a family as it's an inviting, fun, and easy game to play.

# Background Color
I went for a turquoise colour for the site to match the logic images arrows.
I wanted it to give the user a peaceful experience as the game is already chalelning enough without it being too hectic as a background and to focus on the main feature which is the game as to why the background colour is more mute.

The Image breaks down the instructions for the game, it guides the user through the possibilities displaying arrows towards the 2 icons they Win against each.
I chose an image with calm inviting colours & animated images to make the game feel a sense of invitation and warmth.

## H2
Using a striking purple colour to add a bit of character to the page. 
I decided to keep the writing minimal, for the page, with the main feature being the game.
