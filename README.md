HAND WRITTEN WIREFRAME

# Purpose Of the Game
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a brain game.
The game presents to you four different outcomes with each choice. 
2 win and 2 lose. 

I've set up the game so it's the User vs the A.I competing against each other go for go. 
The aim of the game is to get the User's thinking patterns going and competitive nature to beat the computer.
The game is good for all ages, so the specific target audience in particular can be a family as it's an inviting, fun, and easy game to play.

# Background Color
I went for a turquoise colour for the site to match the logic images arrows.
I wanted it to give the user a peaceful experience as the game is already chalelning enough without it being too hectic as a background and to focus on the main feature which is the game as to why the background colour is more mute.

The Image breaks down the instructions for the game, it guides the user through the possibilities displaying arrows towards the 2 icons they Win against each.
I chose an image with calm inviting colours & animated images to make the game feel a sense of invitation and warmth.

# The Logic

Rock -  WINS against Scissors & Lizard but LOSES against Paper & Spock

Paper -  WINS  against Rock & Spock but LOSES against Scissors & Lizard

Scissors - WINS against Paper & Lizard but LOSES against Rock & Spock 

Lizard -  WINS against Paper & Spock but LOSES against Scissors & Rock

Spock - WINS against Scissors & Rock but LOSES against Lizard & Paper


# TITLE 

The title is coloured in a dark grey contrast to the pale turquoise background. Capitals are used for this title, along with large text so the User can see 
straight away what the game is.

## H2
Using a striking purple colour to add a bit of character to the page. 
I decided to keep the writing minimal, for the page, with the main feature being the game.

# The Buttons

The buttons display 5 different colours with 5 different images.
The shape is an oval shape making it big an clear for the User.
I've used vibrant colours, on each button, which are all contrasting to each other, so there's no confusion with colours that look a like.
On the buttons as you hover over them they enlarge and get darker to give the User further understanding that they're about to click on the game.
The buttons are bordered off in a Plum colour area, (the Game area) to make it visual to where the user plays the game.

# COMPUTER SCORE VS USER SCORE

The game counts the scores for the first winner to a score of 10, it's User vs AI. 
I chose 10 so it feels a bit competitive, this logic can obviously be changed to any number in the Javascript code.
It also tells you what beats what as you click on an icon.

You - signifies the score for the User

Computer- signifies the computer score for the user
