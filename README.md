I essentially designed the site to create a brain game for the audience. 
The game makes you think about different outcomes. Everyone knows rock, paper, scissors.
But adding Lizard and Spock sparks some curiosity to the User. 

I hope the game get's the User's thinking patterns going and competitive nature to beat the computer. 
It is good for all ages, so the specific target audience in particular can be a family as it's an inviting, fun, and easy game to play. 




The image breaks down the instructions for the game. It shows what the rules are, it's a really cool contrast with the blue and the green and catchy on the eye. 
This section allows the User to understands the rules before they play the game, with the text beneath it clearly written so if they're confused by the images they know exactly what the icons for the game are. 

The <h2> this is written in a pink colour- & is there to sell the game to the user.

The buttons Img

The Buttons- The buttons display 5 different colours contrasting to each other .  The shape is an oval shape making it visible on the page with a pattern to the layout in the title. 
On the buttons as you hover over them they enlarge and get darker to give the User further understanding that they're about to click on the game.
The buttons are bordered off in a grey area. (the Game area)
